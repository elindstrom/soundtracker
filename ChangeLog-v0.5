2000-09-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.9

	* app/tracker.c: Rewrote expose/draw/update handling.

	* app/sample-display.c: Rewrote expose/draw/update handling a
	little bit (using an idle function).  Now switching notebook pages
	works without problems.

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_handle_keys): If we have a
	selection, play only the selected part of the sample.

	* app/mixer.h: XM Player and mixers can now play part of the
	sample only. Added new method 'setsmplend' to mixer structure for
	this.

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_load_wav_main): Init relnote
	and finetune such that samples are played at C-6 in original
	speed.
	(sample_editor_ok_clicked): Here as well.

	* app/xm.c (xm_freq_note_to_relnote_finetune): If a specified FT
	note is to be played at a specific frequency, return the needed
	relnote and finetune settings.

2000-09-24  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/audio.h: Remove #include <pthread.h> -- fixes compiler
	warnings on IRIX.

	* app/midi-settings.c: Use new prefs_() functions.

	* app/main.c (main): Add dummy drivers if no actual drivers for
	the architecture are available.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c: Cleanups. Changed name appearing to the
	user to "kbfloat", since it's no longer x86-specific.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S (kbasm_mix): val*vl+val*vr =
	val*(vl+vr). Using basic ring properties can help make your code
	shorter :)

	* app/mixers/kbfloat-mix.c: Portable C version of the cubically
	interpolating mixer.

	* configure.in (sgi_support): Added checks for IRIX dmedia
	library. Cleanups. Added '--disable-asm' option.

	* app/xm.c (xm_load_xm_instrument): Endianness-convert envelope
	points to host order.
	(xm_save_xm_instrument): Here as well.

	* app/drivers/irix-output.c: Added IRIX 5.x output driver.

2000-09-19  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.8
	
	* Preliminary Win32 port by Fabian Giesen. Does not compile
	out-of-the-box, since I integrated his 0.5.4 work into 0.5.7
	without being able to test anything. In particular, Makefiles are
	missing. The easiest way should be to build it with Cygwin. Some
	notes for the brave:

	  - app/drivers/dsound-output.c (working as is)

	  - app/preferences.c (needs some work done, see comments)

	  - app/poll.c: added Win32 pipe emulation code. Need to replace
	    all pipe write's and read's in the main program with calls
	    to these functions.

	  - app/keys.c: This is the only part that actually requires
	    hard work for a fully functional Tracker. The current
	    version does not permit pattern editing ;-(

	  - The kb-x86 mixer requires some work if you want to use
	    an assembler other than gas. A manually translated version
	    of the assembler source comes with this archive, though
	    (kb-x86-asmIntel.a).

	  - Non-gcc compilers probably require that some gcc'isms be
	    removed, such as void* arithmetic and interval case statements.

	  - Look at how the GIMP Win32 port is built up; since GIMP also
	    uses the gtk+ toolkit, the building process will be similar.
	
	* app/preferences.h: Directory structure is now hidden from the
	caller; access through opaque prefs_node* handle.

	* app/module-info.c: Update XM's 'modified' flag after various
	operations.

	* app/midi-settings.c: Disable if GNOME is not installed.

	* app/envelope-box.c (envelope_box_canvas_event): Stop point
	dragging when we receive a button release event on the canvas
	(sometimes the appropriate event for the respective point does not
	come - bug in canvas?).

2000-09-18  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/track-editor.c (track_editor_handle_column_input):
	Instrument column uses decimal values always.

	* app/gui.c: Get rid of 'songpos' variable; use
	playlist_get_position() instead.
	(gui_update_player_pos): Some slight reorganization here.

	* app/gui-subs.c (statusbar_update): Run messages through
	gettext().

	* app/gui.c (playlist_position_changed): Don't update current
	pattern if we're in playing mode (that will be done at proper time
	in gui_update_player_pos()).
	(gui_update_player_pos): Freeze playlist signals while updating
	song position.

2000-09-17  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/tracker.c (note2string): Always use decimal numbers for
	instrument numbers.

	* app/gui-settings.c: Automatical Tempo / BPM button update when
	running through Fxx effect is default now.

	* app/event-waiter.[ch]: New more abstract interface for dealing
	with the GUI / audio event syncing issue (this is different from
	time-buffer!). songpos, tempo and bpm updates are handled through
	this interface now. Code is a lot cleaner now.

	* app/gui.c, app/audio.c: In "tempo / bpm update" mode: If the
	user changes tempo / bpm using the interface during playing, we
	use a protective mechanism similar to that used by the "song
	position changed" function.
	
	* po: Updated it.po

2000-08-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/envelope-box.c (envelope_box_canvas_event): Insert new point
	only if insert_after != -1 and y in range.

	* app/tracker.c (print_notes_line): Corrected bounds check.

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_paste_clicked): Only convert
	source data to 8bits if destination sample is in treat_as_8bit
	mode.
	(sample_editor_perform_ramp): If we are in 8bit mode, call cutoff
	function after performing the ramp.

2000-08-17  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@members.com.pl>
 
	* app/track-editor.[ch]: command and volume parameter generator
	(inc/dec) added.
 
	* app/track-editor.c: delete key behaviours like FT2 now.
 
	* app/track-editor.c: set cursor row-step to
	gui_get_current_jump_value() in command and volume column.
 
	* app/gui.c: spin_jump max value changed to 16.
 
2000-08-16  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/xm-player.c (xmpPlayTick, xmpCmdEnvPos): Check if ch->curins
	is initialized before accessing it. Fixes another player crash.

2000-08-15  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.7

	* app/xm.c (XM_Free): Ehhhh... let's free the sample data as well.
	Helps a lot if you don't want a full swap after loading some
	mods. :) (pointed out by (Rikard Bosnjakovic <bos@hack.org>)

	* app/xm.c (xm_load_mod): Close file before returning. (Rikard
	Bosnjakovic <bos@hack.org>)
	(XM_Load): dito
	
	* app/track-editor.c (track_editor_interpolate_fx): Added effect
	interpolator. At the moment only for volume and panning
	effects. Support for other effects is easily added. See README for
	instructions.
	
	* app/gui.c, app/playlist.c: After using spin buttons with mouse,
	the main window focus is immediately reset in order to enable menu
	shortcuts again. Rather hacky, but very useful for keyboard-only
	tracking.

	* app/xm-player.c (xm_player_playnote_fasttracker): If ch->cursamp
	is unitialized, do nothing. Fixes edX crash bug.

	* app/sample-display.c (XPOS_TO_OFFSET): Use temporary guint64
	calcs to prevent overflow in case of large samples. Large samples
	are now edited without problems in SoundTracker.
	(sample_display_startoffset_to_xpos):
	(sample_display_endoffset_to_xpos): dito
	(sample_display_set_mixer_position): Move code that decides which
	parts of the widget to redraw to sample_display_draw().

	* app/gui.c (playlist_position_changed): Choice of current song
	position changes currently edited pattern as well.
	(keyevent): Stop GDK_Tab and GDK_Return key press event signal
	from propagating to the entry widgets.

	* app/sample-display.c (sample_display_set_mixer_position): area.x
	+ area.width must not exceed width of widget.

	* app/sample-editor.c: We load raw samples now (8/16 bits,
	signed/unsigned, little-endian/big-endian, mono/stereo).

	* app/xm.c (xm_save_xm_samples): Endianness conversion on saving.

	* INSTALL: Some words about the dangers of suid root installation.

	* app/Makefile.am (install-exec-local): Added warning due to suid
	root installation.

	* app/gui.c: Call statusbar functions while loading/saving
	modules.

	* app/xm.c: Don't call statusbar functions from this file. That's
	the job of app/gui.c.

	* app/xm.c (xm_load_xm_pattern): Accept length 0 patterns (create
	a dummy 1-length pattern for it).

2000-08-14  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/gui-settings.c: "Save unused patterns" is default now.

	* app/gui.c (gui_free_xm): Clear xm pointer after freeing.

2000-08-12  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/tracker.c (print_notes_line): Added color for selection
	background to colors array.
	(tracker_draw): Reordered drawing calls; less flickering during

2000-06-04  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@members.com.pl>

	* app/sample-editor.c: added "set as loop" function.

	* app/sample-editor.c: added "half" and "double" buttons in volume
	ramp dialog to set 50% or 200% for left and right spinbuttons.

	* app/track-editor.[ch]: added track_editor_kill_notes_track
	function which kill all notes from cursor position to the end of
	pattern.
 
2000-05-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.5

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_close_volume_ramp_dialog):
	Remember last used values.
	(sample_editor_open_volume_ramp_dialog): Allow negative values as
	well.

2000-05-20  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/xm.c (xm_load_xm_instrument): Handling instrument header
	size correctly. ST loads a few more XMs where it complained about
	"instrument header size != 40" before.

2000-05-13  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/sample-display.c (sample_display_set_mixer_position):
	Correct expose/draw behaviour now; calculating widget areas are
	redrawn in this function rather than in _draw() now. This was what
	I thought to be a bug in gtk+, but it wasn't :)

2000-05-08  Luc Tanguay  <luc.tanguay@bell.ca>
 
	* app/xm.h: added constant for XM min/max note volume.

	* app/midi.c: fixed problem when MIDI velocity is out of the range
	of the volume of a XM note.
 
2000-05-03  Luc Tanguay  <luc.tanguay@bell.ca>
 
	* app/midi-settings.[ch]: MIDI settings dialog box and load/save
	functions.

	menu.  Save MIDI settings when "Save settings now" is clicked.
 
	* app/midi.c: updated to use new MIDI settings.  The volume and/or
	channel info from the MIDI event can be turned on and off.  The
	input client number or port can be changed.

	the Fxx command.

	* Added option to switch back to tracker page after loading /
	saving.
	
2000-05-01  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/drivers/*-output.c (prefs_update_estimate): Use
	"milliseconds" instead of "microseconds", that's nearer to the
	truth (Rob Adamson).

	* po: Updated ja.po

2000-04-29  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.4

	* Applied patch from Tomasz Maka ("save song" option).

2000-04-15  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/scope-group.c (scope_group_new): Initialize update frequency
	from gui_settings structure.

	* app/track-editor.c (tracker_page_create): Initialize update
	frequency from gui_settings structure.

	* app/audio.c (mixer_mix_and_handle_scopes): Clipflag handling
	improved; keeps the flag on for a moment before switching it off
	again, so that clippings get visible, even if they are short.

	* app/sample-editor.c: Has its own timeout function to display
	current mixer position.

	* app/audio.c (mixer_mix_and_handle_scopes): Get mixer_position
	dumps at regular, configurable intervals. Defaulting to 50 updates
	per second for now.

	* app/file-operations.c (file_selection_dir_button): Check if
	something has been selected actually. Fixes occasional segfault
	when doing double-clicks in the directory list (reported by
	Giles).

2000-04-09  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: Added non-volramping version of mixer
	(gives another 15% speedup).

	* app/module-info.c (modinfo_pack_patterns): Reinitialize playlist
	widget after changing the pattern order table.

	* app/main.c (main): Print error message if no output driver is
	available and exit.
	(sigsegv_handler): Capture segmentation faults and try to rescue
	currently edited XM.

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_monitor_clicked): Return if
	no input driver available.

	* app/audioconfig.c (audioconfig_load_config): Works without input
	drivers.

	* app/main.c (main): Don't require input drivers.

2000-04-08  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/xm-player.c (xmplayer_play_note):
	(xmplayer_play_note_full): Stop old sample before starting new one
	(prevents clicks when playing live on the keyboard).

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_setsmplpos): Declick this situation
	as well.
	
2000-04-01  Luc Tanguay  <tanguay@asterix>
 
	* app/midi.c: MIDI input recorded only if track editor visible and
	edit mode enabled.

2000-03-30  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86*: removed unused code.

2000-03-29  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.3

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_stopnote): Rewrote sample-change
	declicking to use a virtual second channel for each logical
	channel. See comments in the source code.
	(kb_x86_mix_sub): Disabled sample-end exponential declicking,
	because it sounds like shit on white-noise samples
	(i.e. hi-hats). See comments in kb-x86.c for why.

	* configure.in: Changed the autoconf stuff in order to check for
	gasp and disable build of the kb_x86 mixer if it's not available.
	We should now build on non-i386 platforms again.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: Fix for newer gasp (remove \(.data) and
	use .section .data instead). (kbasm_declick_postproc): Fix an
	assembler warning only issued by newer binutils than mine (there
	is no faddp %st(1),%st; only faddp %st,%st(1)).
	(kbasm_mix): Fixed the other related warning (changed call %ebp to
	call *%ebp, whatever sense that has).

2000-03-28  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c: Added linear ramp declicking upon sample
	change on channel (not only when the sample ends, but also when a
	new one is started immediately). Also making use of the asm
	routines' volume ramping functions to smoothen volume changes.
	Using 1ms ramps. Seems to be okay for all the mods I've listened
	to so far.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_mix_sub): Reordered some 64bit
	calculations to optimize gcc output. Also fixed a typo bug in
	pingpong handling.

	* po: Updated ja.po

2000-03-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/integer32.c: Fix non-i386 code (declare some
	variables properly).

	* app/sample-editor.c: Removed #include <sys/soundcard.h> (hint by
	Nicolas Leveille)

	* Released v0.5.2

	* po: Updated ja.po

2000-03-27  Luc Tanguay  <luc.tanguay@bell.ca>
	
	* app/midi.[ch], app/midi-utils.[ch]: code to add MIDI input.

2000-03-26  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/gui.c (gui_init): Status bar is in a GNOME dock item now and
	can be moved around. Non-GNOME bar is at the bottom of the window
	by default.

	* app/gui-subs.c (statusbar_update): Added new argument
	"force_update" which forces a GUI update in order to make the
	"Loading XXX..."  messages actually visible.

	* app/envelope-box.c (envelope_box_point_event): If a point is
	dragged out of sight, the canvas scrolls to the new location as
	soon as the button has been released.

2000-03-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/envelope-box.c (envelope_box_canvas_event): Middle mouse
	button scrolls the canvas (just like the sample display widget).
	(envelope_box_canvas_event): Middle mouse button plus Shift zooms
	in and out.
	(spin_offset_changed):
	(envelope_box_delete_point): Adjust canvas max x.

	* Released v0.5.1

	* po: Updated it.po. Added fr.po from Saïd Bougribate
	<Linus4@caramail.com>.

	* app/instrument-editor.c (instrument_editor_update): Disable
	"Save XI" button if no instrument loaded.

	* app/sample-editor.c: Remove all references to
	mixer_sample_word_length(). Assume 16bit.

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_reverse_clicked): Don't
	access sample pointed to by sample end, only the one before.

	* app/menubar.c: Added "Tracker" submenu to "Settings" menu,
	containing the 'cycle font' functions.

	* app/tracker-settings.[ch]: Tracker font selection - you can fill
	a list with your favourite fonts and then cycle through them with
	Keypad-Plus/Minus from within the tracker. You should use only
	fixed-width fonts for now..

2000-03-22  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Applied patch from Tomasz Maka <pasp@look.com.pl> for status
	bar, timer, "show zeroes" and "channel numbering" options.

2000-03-19  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_mix_sub): Optimizing for the
	non-filtered case. Gives a speed-up of roughly 15% on plain XMs.
	I expected more, though :)

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: Created a big 'gasp' macro which can
	generate various versions of the mixer core routine without having
	to c'n'p eight different versions.

2000-03-14  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* po: Updated ja.po.

2000-03-13  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.5.0

	* app/audio.c (mixer_mix): Stereo to mono conversion works now.

	* app/xm.h: Added "treat_as_8bit" variable so that 8bit sample
	handling can still be faked to the user by the GUI.

	* app/mixer.h: Removed "type" field from st_mixer_sample_info. All
	samples are stored in 16bit format internally now. Removes a lot
	of duplicate code in sample-editor.c and in the mixers.

2000-03-12  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/integer32.c: Adjusted for 16bit scope buffers.

	* app/audio.c: Using 16bit scope buffers now. Makes the mixer
	routines faster.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c, app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: Added scopes
	handling.

	* app/xm.c: Load XM's with odd number of channels as well
	(generate empty channel in that case).

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_updatesample): Can handle updates of
	loop limits while playing.

	* app/audio.c (driver_startnote): Don't call mixer if sample is
	empty.

	* app/audioconfig.c, app/audio.c, app/main.c: You can choose a
	mixer module now.

2000-03-10  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_mix_sub): Added pingpong loop
	handling. Been listening to some of my favourite modules for quite
	some time now and I haven't discovered any more mixing bugs. And
	it sounds just great :-)

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: Added backwards mixing function.

2000-03-09  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/cheat-sheet.c: Added new effects.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S (kbasm_mix): Enabled IT filter
	code. Sounds crappy. No wonder, this is a one-tap IIR filter.  But
	IT just sounds like that.

	* app/audio.c (driver_set_ch_filter_*), app/mixer.h: Added player
	interface for filter commands.

	* app/xm-player.c (xm_player_playnote_fasttracker, xmpPlayTick):
	Don't set procins = 0 when procnot==97
	(xmpPlayTick): Added filter commands.
	(xmpPlayTick): Some Mxx fixes. (all these changes taken from
	latest OpenCP CVS).

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c: Looping code and no-loop code unified. Now
	bullet-proof with regards to extremely short loop lengths. Added
	declicking logic for sample ends. Still no ping-pong loop support.

2000-03-08  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c: Rewrote complete loop handling code in C
	and corrected it so as to deal with unmodified samples (the
	interpolation code would read three invalid sample values after
	the loop end otherwise). Actually, this required loop prediction
	logic to be written similar to integer32.c. This thing sounds
	great :-)

2000-03-06  Jason Nunn  <jsno@downunder.net.au>

	* app/xm.c: Soundtracker can now load compressed zip lzh gz bz2
	modules.

2000-03-05  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c, app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S: First try at
	incorporating Tammo Hinrich's brandnew FPU mixer code into
	SoundTracker. I have ported two versions, one with linear
	interpolation and one with cubic interpolation (both have code for
	the IT filters). Support for Ping-Pong loops, 8 bit samples and
	oscilloscopes is missing, though.

2000-03-03  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/scope-group.c (scope_group_timeout): Add some hackery to
	deal with too short latencies and the scopes dropping out.

	* app/gui.c: The Win95 Menu key now plays all channels of the
	current row only. Nice ProTracker feature.

	* app/audio.c (audio_ctlpipe_play_pattern): Support "only1row"
	argument. Use edit-mode driver for the single row play feature.

	* app/xm-player.c: Hacked support for playing only one row of the
	current pattern and then stopping.

	* app/gui-settings.c (gui_settings_dialog): Renamed
	advance_cursor_in_fx_columns to "Advance cursor horizontally in
	effect columns".

	* app/gui.c, app/track-editor.c, app/gui-settings.[ch]: Added
	asynchronous IT-style editing where you can still edit patterns
	while playing them and the patterns don't scroll. Use "Escape"
	after starting playing the song or pattern to enable editing
	mode. "Space" still stops the song.

	* po: Updated ru.po.
