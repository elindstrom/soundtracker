2004-01-11  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* Released v0.6.7

	* app/sample-editor.c: When copying a sample and pasting into an
	empty one, the settings for volume, finetune, panning and relnote
	are transferred, too.

	* Added patch from Yury for a more general Cut/Copy/Paste
	handling. Now there's only one such set of functions in the Edit
	menu, the functionality of which depends on the currently active
	notebook page (tracker / instrument / sample editor).

	* app/xm.c (xm_load_xm_pattern): Handling non-standard pattern
	header sizes (yaliaev)

	* app/gui.c (gui_final): Default octave is now 3 instead of 5, so
	that freshly loaded samples can be triggered at their original
	speed with the Q key.

	* app/sample-editor.c: Cleaned up sndfile / audiofile code (a lot
	of stuff was previously duplicated via #if's), fixed saving of
	8-bit samples via libsndfile. When loading raw samples (when
	compiled with libsndfile), we ask the user for the sampling
	frequency now, just like in the case of libaudiofile. Also fixed
	loading of 8-bit samples (treat_as_8bit is now set correctly).

	* app/gui.c (gui_playlist_position_changed): Fixed handling of the
	"Lock edited pattern" button (problem reported by yaliaev).
	
2004-01-04  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/track-editor.c (track_editor_do_the_note_key): Added patch
	from yaliaev which removes cursor horizontal displacement when you
	try some tune at the keyboard in jazz mode (of course, only if ST
	not in the editing mode, jazz editing mode works just like
	before).

	* Added soundtracker-0.6.7pre6-patexpshrink.patch.bz2 from
	yaliaev, providing vertical pattern expansion / shrinking.

	* app/gui.c, app/keys.c, app/playlist.c: Fix some gcc-3.2
	warnings (yaliaev).

	* app/cheat-sheet.c, app/gui.c, app/instrument-editor.c: Add some
	#includes for non-GNOME version, fix for measure selection window
	(yaliaev).

	* configure.in, app/mixers/Makefile.am, app/mixers/kb-x86-asm.S:
	Added patch from yaliaev to remove dependency of soundtracker on
	gasp.

2003-10-27  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* po: Updated it, ja, pl, ru translations. Added sk (slovakian)
	translation.

2003-08-04  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre6 (without official
	announcement).

	* app/gui.c, app/gui-settings.c, app/menubar.c, *.xpm: Added patch
	from yaliaev: Nice icons in the control panel, Direct access to
	accidentals and row highlighting configuration from the control
	panel, Option to allow/prevent edited pattern from changing when
	browsing in the playlist.

	* app/st-subs.c (st_sample_16bit_signed_unsigned): Fixed
	signed->unsigned conversion (tugruettmueller).

	* app/playlist.c (playlist_insert_pattern): Emitting
	SONG_LENGTH_CHANGED signal after inserting new pattern. Fixes
	incorrect XM playlist update handling when inserting
	patterns. (reported by yaliaev).

2003-07-05  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@ll.pl>

	* app/gui.c, app/file-operations.[ch]: Function for refresh
	(fileops_refresh_list) file/dir list in file requesters was added.

2003-06-29  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui.c (gui_final): Add tooltips to pitchbend and
	amplification sliders (yaliaev).

	* app/audio.c (audio_mix): Fix memset at the end of file
	rendering, clearing the unrendered part of the mixing buffer
	(yaliaev). This fix might contribute to stabilizing the WAV export
	which has been reported to be unstable by some people.

	* po: Updated fr, it, sv translations.

2003-05-24  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre5 (without official
	announcement).
	
	* app/main.c (main): Calling gui_play_stop() before quitting, so
	that the audio driver is shut down correctly (for JACK).

	* app/keys.c, app/gui.c: Defined two new keys for "increase /
	decrease jump value" (yaliaev).

	* app/keys.c, app/track-editor.c: Defined quick-jump keys to jump
	to channels. Can also mute channels with keyboard when these keys
	are pressed together with SPACE (yaliaev).

	* app/midi-settings.h: Removed #ifdef ALSA_DRIVER_09x around
	gboolean auto_connect definition in struct midi_input_prefs. Now
	SoundTracker compiles with alsa 0.5.x again. I have no idea if it
	works, though.

	* configure.in: Changed GNOME detection code; new code taken from
	xchat-1.8.8. The old code broke at version detection on some
	systems.

	* app/st-subs.c (st_is_empty_track): Advance notes pointer in
	loop. Also, the loop end condition is length > 0 instead of length
	>= 0. Up to now, this function would only check if the very first
	row in the pattern is non-empty, leading to patterns left out
	during saving. Argh. Thanks to Henri Jylkkä <hj@bsdmail.org> for
	helping to reproduce the bug. Also, CTRL-F and CTRL-G (find / copy
	to unused pattern) work again now.

 	* po: Updated ja.po, no.po, it.po.

	* configure.in: Under NetBSD, check if OSS driver needs -lossaudio

2003-05-18  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/drivers/sun-input.c, app/drivers/sun-output.c: Fixes
	(wcobb).

	* configure.in: Add -lossaudio to linker options for OpenBSD OSS
	emulation layer. (wcobb)

	* app/gui.c (file_selected), app/sample-editor.c,
	app/instrument-editor.c: Check if a file was actually
	selected. Previously, the gtk+ file selector could return with
	just a directory name as 'file name', and SoundTracker would treat
	that as a file to operate on, leading to strange behavior.
	
	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre4 (without official
	announcement).
	
	* app/playlist.c: User can now click on playlist entries to make
	them the current position (yaliaev).

	* flat.xpm, sharp.xpm: Made a bit larger (yaliaev).

	* po/POTFILES.in: Added some more source files.

	* app/Makefile.am (install-exec-local): On NetBSD and OpenBSD, the
	root group is called 'wheel' (wcobb, Henri Jylkka
	<henri.jylkka@mbnet.fi>). On Darwin (MacOS X), it is 'admin'
	(Mathias Meyer <mathmeye@users.sourceforge.net>).

	* configure.in, app/main.c, app/drivers/Makefile.am: Sun audio
	driver integration (wcobb)

2003-05-17  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/drivers/jack-output.c: Added patch for latest JACK CVS (by
	Anthony <avan@uwm.edu>).

	* po: Updated it.po

	* configure.in: Rewrote some parts of configure.in and several
	Makefile.am's to use AM_CONDITIONALs where they are guaranteed to
	be executed. Extended several Makefile.am's to make use of
	conditional compilation -- this way some '#if defined(XXX)' around
	complete source files can be removed and compilation is faster.

2003-04-27  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/track-editor.c (tracker_timeout): Removed
	g_assert(current_driver_object) and replaced it with a simple
	check, because the situation tested for can actually occur
	legally.

	* app/gui.c (gui_editpat_changed): gui_mixer_set_pattern() is
	called here only when we are in 'playing pattern' mode.
	(gui_set_current_pattern): Removed call to
	gui_mixer_set_pattern().
	(offset_current_pattern): Use gtk_spin_button_set_value() to set
	new pattern.

2003-04-12  Luc Tanguay  <lucus_at_sympatico.ca>

	* Updated MIDI code to support ALSA 0.9.x.

2003-04-03  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/drivers/oss-{in|out}put.c: Corrected soundcard.h
	inclusion. Now compiles under NetBSD (thanks Frank Knappe
	<knappe@tu-harburg.de> and Henri Jylkka <henri.jylkka@mbnet.fi>).

2003-03-29  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* po: Updated ja.po

	* configure.in: Correct detection of ALSA v0.9, v0.5 and <older>.
	(modified patch from ltanguay).

2003-03-09  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui.c (gui_save_wav_callback, play_song): Removed
	superfluous calls to gui_set_current_pattern().

	* app/drivers/file-output.c (sndfile_new): Initializing d->sndbuf
	and d->polltag to NULL. Fixes a crash when trying to save WAV via
	libsndfile on my machine.

	* Fixed libsndfile detection.

	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre3 (without official
	announcement).
	
	* Updated ja.po.

2003-03-08  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui.c (gui_playlist_position_changed): Start event waiter
	first, THEN send "set songpos" request to mixer. Fixes occasional
	hanging playlist display when changing playlist position manually
	during playback.

	* app/drivers/sun-input.c, app/drivers/sun-output.c: From Wilbern
	Cobb. Integration with configure.in is still missing.

	* app/drivers/oss-input.c, app/drivers/oss-output.c, configure.in:
	Including {sys/|machine/|<nothing>}/soundcard.h depending on which
	is present (wcobb).

	* app/menubar.c: Added toggleitem for disabling the splash screen
	(i.e., automatically closing it).

	* app/gui-subs.c (gui_hang_tooltip): Only allocate GtkTooltips
	once.

	* app/gui.c (gui_insert_free_pattern,
	gui_insert_free_pattern_and_copy): Cleaned up, checking for
	maximum playlist length.

	* app/gui-subs.c (gui_update_adjustment): Use gfloat for p instead
	of int. Fixes some weird position jumping in the new playlist
	editor when deleting or inserting items. Moved from gui-subs.c to
	playlist.c, because it is playlist-specific.

	* app/playlist.c: Merged playlist_insert_pattern() and
	playlist_insert_clicked().

	* app/playlist.[ch], app/gui.[ch]: New FastTracker-style playlist
	editor by Yury.

2003-03-02  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre2 (without official
	announcement).
	
	* Added patch from Yury for correcting
	right-mouse-button-over-scopes semantics to agree with FT2.

	* Added patch from Yury for displaying a pixmap for a muted
	channel instead of a zero line only. Fixed this for the case when
	no actual PNG file is installed.

	* Added patch from Yury for B<->H note name switching and
	flat/sharp notation selection. I downscaled the provided icons to
	a height of 16 pixels to agree with the standard GNOME stockicon
	size.

	* Added patch from Yury for handling arbitary XM instrument header
	sizes in xm.c::xm_load_xm_instrument().

	* Added patch from Yury adding some gettext() calls here and there
	to actually translate strings.

	* Added patch from Yury for XP pattern import/export.

	* Added patch from Tomasz Maka <pasp@ll.pl>.
	  + app/tracker.c: Channel numbers are more useful now
	    (centered above track on a separate line)
	  + app/tracker.[ch], app/gui.c: Different cursor color
	    in edit mode.

	* Added norwegian translation by Petter Johan Olsen
	<petter.olsen@cc.uit.no>. Updated russian translation by Yury.

	* Added latest version of JACK output driver. Changes:
	  + Multiple clients: soundtracker_0-9
	  + Output ports renamed: out_1, out_2
	  + Driver release now waits for declicking to finish
	  + GUI issues fixed
	  + no slave transport mode
	  + master mode is not saved in the config by choice
	  (by Anthony <avan@uwm.edu>)
	
2003-02-02  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* "Released" soundtracker-0.6.7pre1 (without official
	announcement).
	
	* New danish translation (da.po) by Keld Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>.

	* app/gui.c (gui_update_title): Rewritten using g_strdup_printf()
	and g_basename(), fixes a crash when starting ST with a module
	filename as command line argument.

	* Applied patch from Anthony Van Groningen <avan@uwm.edu> adding
	JACK support to SoundTracker. Some configure.in / Makefile fixes
	for this by Kai Vehmanen <kai.vehmanen@wakkanet.fi>.
	
	* Spent some hours getting the autoconf stuff to work with the
	latest autoconf-2.57 / automake-1.7.2. I hate this.

	* Applied patch from Erik de Castro Lopo <erikd-100@mega-nerd.com>
	implementing libsndfile support in addition to
	libaudiofile. libsndfile is now default, and if it is not found,
	libaudiofile is used.

2002-10-20  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/file-operations.c (fileops_filesel_pre_insertion /
	post_removal): Only hide confirm area (OK and Cancel buttons) if
	this is a single-click dialog. In the save dialogs, we need these
	buttons (reported by qmax).

	* app/playlist.c (playlist_delete_clicked): Was buggy when delete
	the very last playlist entry (garbled the last-but-one playlist
	entry).

2002-09-18  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/tracker.c (tracker_button_press): Now you can use your loved
	mouse wheel to scroll through the patterns, just like Up and Down
	arrows. But not only. Holding Left Shift and turning the wheel,
	you can scroll left and right throug the pattern, as if you use
	the scrollbar below the tracker window. (yaliaev)

	* app/sample-editor.c: When a raw sample is loaded, a combo box
	shows up and asks for the sampling rate. The default value is set
	to 8363, but you can also select another predefined value or enter
	one by hand. Also, the standard note is changed from C-6 to C-4,
	so a 8363 Hz sample will now result in realnote=0; finetune=0; and
	a 44100 Hz one in realnote=29; finetune=-28. (tugruettmueller)

	* app/gui.c: Write the name of the module being edited in the main
	window title. (yaliaev)

2002-08-17  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* In various files, added GPOINTER_TO_INT() and GINT_TO_POINTER()
	macro calls. In the assembler files, added _C_LABEL() macro to
	handle differing OS conventions for label prefixes. Makes ST work
	on OpenBSD/sparc64 and OpenBSD/i386 (by wcobb).

	* app/xm.c (xm_freq_note_to_relnote_finetune): Forcing finetune
	into interval [-63,+63], removed restriction for relnote in
	[-96,+96] (by tugruettmueller).
	
	* app/gui.c (gui_numchans_changed): Round down odd channel numbers
	when entered manually (by yaliaev).
	(gui_handle_standard_keys): Shift + Crsr Left / Right browses
	playlist (by yaliaev).

2002-07-20  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/playlist.c (playlist_insert_clicked): Fixed a bug that
	caused "Insert" to destroy the last playlist entry. Also, we're
	now inserting the current pattern instead of duplicating the
	playlist entry.

2002-07-18  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui-settings.[ch]: Removed option 'Save XM saves all
	non-empty patterns' and made this the default behaviour: all
	non-empty patterns are always saved; if the user wants to have a
	small, clean file, he can run 'Optimize Module'.

	* app/sample-display.c (sample_display_draw_data): Fixed 'sample
	was displayed reversed vertically' bug once and for all. Still
	wasn't working properly.

2002-06-28  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/sample-display.c (sample_display_draw_data): Yet another fix
	to the sample display (Mardy <mardy@users.sourceforge.net>).

	* soundtracker.desktop: Changed 'Type' from 'Multimedia' to
	'Application'. Now SoundTracker appears in the GNOME menu again.
	Reported by Bastien Nocera <hadess@hadess.net>.
	
	* app/mixers/kbfloat-mix.c (CUBICMIXER_LOOP_FORWARD): Moved s0
	initialization from LOOP_START macro to both LOOP_FORWARD and
	LOOP_BACKWARD, adding a missing minus sign before positionf in
	LOOP_BACKWARD. Now backwards mixing is done correctly, without
	noise (reported by Yury Aliaev <mutabor@catholic.org>).

2002-06-17  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui.c (gui_splash): Calling gdk_rgb_init() after
	gnome_init(), which is officially required, but the splash screen
	happened to work on my installation nevertheless, just not on some
	others..

	* po: Updated fr, ja, sv, ru, it. New croation translation (hr.po)
	by Denis Lackovic <delacko@fly.srk.fer.hr>.

	* app/transposition.c (transposition_transpose_notes_sub):
	"Current Instrument" and "All Instruments" modes were swapped
	(reported by Michal Seta <mis@creazone.com>)

	* app/tips-dialog.c: Actually feeding the tips through _() now
	(reported by Yuri Bongiorno <yuri.bongiorno@logika.com>)

2002-05-20  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* Released v0.6.6

	* Oh, yeah. NLS was completely b0rken. Updated to gettext-0.10.37.

	* Released v0.6.5

	* app/tracker.c (tracker_set_font): Test if font width and height
	have sane values. Fixes crash with the 'clearlyu' font reported by
	Trevor Nunes <lutes159@home.com>.

	* app/playlist.c: Hack to set page increment to 5.0 for the
	current pos and restart pos spinbuttons.

	* app/sample-display.c: Flipped display vertically; now the
	positive sample values are at the top, and the negative ones at
	the bottom (patch by Mardy <mardy@users.sourceforge.net>).
	
2002-05-17  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/menubar.c: For non-GNOME SoundTracker, wrote some code that
	converts the GNOME menu tree structure into GtkItemFactoryEntry's
	at run-time, so we can finally get rid of the extra GTK+-only menu
	tree and its associated translation-induced problems (maintenance
	nightmare).

	* app/track-editor.c (track_editor_copy_selection): When marking a
	block with CTRL-B, CTRL-C and CTRL-V (copy and cut) stop marking
	automatically. This should always have been the case, but somehow
	in v0.6.4 an extra CTRL-B was necessary.

	* app/menubar.c: Added selection transposition stuff.

	* app/transposition.c (transposition_transpose_selection):
	Backported from CVS.

	* app/track-editor.c (track_editor_editmode_status_idle_function):
	Using idle function here as well in order to workaround
	gtk_label_set_text() slowness.

2002-05-16  Michael Krause  <mk@soundtracker.org>

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_set_selection_label): Moved
	the actual gtk_label_set_text() to an idle function, because it
	has become incredibly slow somewhere on the way to gtk+-1.2.10.
	Fixes sample range selection slowness (see comment).

	* app/menubar.c: Renamed "use backing store" to "flicker-free
	scrolling", which can actually be understood by non-coders.

	* app/tracker-settings.c (trackersettings_new): Button relayout.

	* app/gui-settings.c: Removed AA canvas option. Removed channel
	numbering option (hey, removing superfluous preferences is a good
	thing). Renamed some other options.

	* app/envelope-box.c (envelope_box_new): Always using standard
	non-antialiased canvas. With GNOME 1.0 and GNOME 1.2, AA canvas is
	buggy; with GNOME 1.4, it doesn't even work.
	
	* po: Updated fr.po.

2002-02-17  Michael Krause  <rawstyle@soundtracker.org>

	* configure.in: Check for gdk-pixbuf >= 0.8.0 (in fact, I don't
	know which is the minimum version required). Needed for splash
	screen.

	* app/tips-dialog.c (tips_dialog_get_vbox): Function to create the
	vbox without a window, for the splash screen.

	* app/gui.c (gui_init): Separated into gui_splash() and
	gui_final().  The former displays a splash screen, and integrates
	the tips.

2002-02-09  Michael Krause  <rawstyle@soundtracker.org>

	* app/gui-settings.c (gui_settings_save_config): Moved geometry
	saving from save_always() to this function.

	* app/file-operations.c (fileops_tmpclean): Removed error checks,
	especially the ungraceful exit(-1) :-)
	
	* po: Updated fr.po (new translation by Michel Robitaille
	<robitail@IRO.UMontreal.CA>), added sv.po (by Christian Rose
	<menthos@menthos.com>).

2002-01-15  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@ll.pl>

	* app/file-operations.[ch]: Added fileops_tmpclean function to
	remove ~/.soundtracker/tmp contents.

	* app/xm.c (xm_check_envelope): Set first envelope point offset to
	0.

2002-01-13  Michael Krause  <rawstyle@soundtracker.org>

	* Actually putting config.guess and config.sub into the .tar.gz
	distribution. Last time they were missing, strange.

	* app/gui.[ch]: Moved WELCOME_MESSAGE define to gui.c so that it
	is internationalized (reported by Yuri Bongiorno
	<yuri.bongiorno@logika.com>).

	* app/gui-settings.c (gui_settings_save_config): Don't forget to
	save scopes_buffer_size (reported by Chauk-Mean Proum
	<chauk-mean.proum@fr.thalesgroup.com>).

	* po: Updated ru.po and it.po.

2001-12-22  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@ll.pl>

	* app/errors.c, sample-display.c, scope-group.c: Added missing
	'string.h' headers.

	* app/xm.c: Added new st specific tmpnam function (called
	'st_tmpnam') to avoid gcc warrning. Generates temporary files in
	~/.soundtracker/tmp/ instead of in /tmp/.

	* app/gui.c (gui_handle_standard_keys): If we are in instrument or
	sample editor notebook page 'Space' key stops playing without edit
	mode switching.

2001-12-08  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@ll.pl>

	* app/gui.c, gui-settings.[ch], menubar.c: Added option to save
	tracker's window geometry.

	* app/module-info.c (modinfo_optimize_module): Module optimize
	function has small info requester now.

2001-12-07  Tomasz Maka  <pasp@ll.pl>

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_set_selection_label): When
	selection exist length label show size of selected block instead
	of entire sample size.

	* app/sample-editor.c: Ask user for action if saving file
	(sample or region) already exist.

2001-08-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* po: Updated de.po and es.po.

2001-08-12  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.6.4

	* app/clavier.c (clavier_init): If "5x8" font can't be found, use
	"fixed".

	* Added 'config.guess' and 'config.sub' files from automake
	distribution (reported by Wilbern Cobb <cobb@vedge.com.ar>).

2001-08-04  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/drivers/oss-input.c: Made "/dev/dsp" configurable.
	(oss_release): Only remove polltag if polltag != 0. Fixes a glib
	warning.

	* app/audioconfig.c (audioconfig_clist_select): When a different
	driver is selected, don't just leave the default settings, but
	load the settings from disk if there are saved settings.

2001-07-31  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/drivers/oss-output.c: Made "/dev/dsp" configurable.

2001-07-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_init_sample): If instrument
	is initialized, initialize sample map with current sample number,
	too.

	* app/tips-dialog.c: Added tip "Is your cursor trapped in a number
	entry field? Just press Return or Tab to free yourself!".

	* soundtracker.spec: Disable ALSA when building an RPM.

	* po: Added gl.po by Xosé Anxo Pereira Torreiro
	<pereira@iponet.es>.

2001-06-15  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/main.c (main): On Linux, we use setresuid()/setresgid()
	instead of seteuid()/setegid() in order to make gtk+-1.2.10 happy.
	Otherwise, SoundTracker doesn't run if installed suid-root.
	
2001-05-24  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.6.3

	* app/audio.c (audio_ctlpipe_stop_playing): If audio_songpos_ew is
	still active, confirm it. This fixes the crash that occurs when
	pressing Ctrl directly after changing the playback position
	(during playback), reported by Aki Kemppainen
	<kemppaia@assari.cc.tut.fi>

	* app/audioconfig.c (audioconfig_save_config): prefs_open_write()
	was accidentally called with an argument "rw" instead of a real
	file-name, so the audio settings never got saved!! I wonder why
	nobody reported this.

2001-03-05  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* po: Updated ru.po, it.po.

2001-01-03  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.6.2

2000-12-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_save_wav_main): Check for
	existence of dynamic loader functions, and use audiofile-0.2.0
	code if not.

2000-12-23  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/sample-editor.c (sample_editor_save_wav_main): Fix sample
	format initialization for libaudiofile-0.2.0.

2000-12-20  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/tracker-settings.c (trackersettings_read_fontlist),
	app/tracker.c (tracker_init): Default font is now 'fixed'. 7x13
	appears not to be present on all X installations (Florian Heinz
	<sky@sysv.de>) pointed this out.
	
2000-12-16  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/fr.po: Updated french translation (XxKarLKoXxX@aol.com)

2000-12-09  Rob Adamson  <r.adamson@hotpop.com>

	* app/xm.c: Escape filenames that are passed to the shell for
	decompressing.

2000-10-30  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/gui.c (keyevent): Removed old "capture_keys" logic, and
	replaced it by a simple check if the window's current focus lies
	on an entry widget. Finally, the spin buttons are editable using
	the keyboard!

	* app/gui.c: Replaced all gtk_spin_button_new() by
	extspinbutton_new() plus disabled size hack (in order to get the
	"changed" callback mentioned below into effect).
	
	* app/extspinbutton.c: Added option to disable the horizontal size
	hack, and added "changed" callback that immediately removes focus
	from widget if the value has been changed using the mouse.

2000-10-22  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.6.1

2000-10-20  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* po/sl.po: Added slovene translation by Matej Erman.

	* app/mixers/midi.c, midi-settings.[ch], midi-utils.c: Updates
	from Luc Tanguay; The MIDI Settings dialog box now includes a page
	for Output parameters (for future dev.) and one for Misc
	parameters. This last page has one parameter for now: debug level
	(to allow MIDI users to see the MIDI events SoundTracker is
	receiving). Will be useful when MIDI events will be assignable to
	SoundTracker commands.

	* app/mixers/kb-x86.c (kb_x86_mix_sub): Remove g_assert(pos >=
	ch->sample->loopstart). This is simply not true for short loops.

2000-09-28  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	changes due to the recent change of sample.data from void* to
	gint16*. Fixes some crashes..

2000-09-26  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* app/midi-settings.c (midi_load_config): Yet another compilation
	fix :)
